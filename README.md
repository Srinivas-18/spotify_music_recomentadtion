INTRODUCTION-
"In this project, we dive into building a personalized music recommendation system. Music recommendation systems help users discover new songs and artists based on their preferences. Using Python, NLP, and deep learning techniques, weâ€™ll harness the Spotify API to create recommendations that mirror the algorithms behind streaming giants like Spotify and Apple Music."
Objective-
"To implement a recommendation system that recommends music tailored to user preferences and musical history, helping users explore new music in a personalized manner."
How Music Recommandation System Works-
This section explains the recommendation algorithms and processes:
"Recommendation systems use advanced algorithms to analyze users' listening history, liked and disliked tracks, and even feedback. Here are some popular approaches:
Content-Based Filtering: Recommends music based on similarities to previously liked songs.
Collaborative Filtering: Finds users with similar listening habits to generate recommendations.
Hybrid Systems: Combines both methods to boost recommendation quality."
HYBRID SYSTEMS APPROACH IS USED IN IT
Why Use Spotify API?
Spotify API Introduction:
"The Spotify API provides access to a vast catalog of music data, including track information, artist details, playlists, and audio features like tempo and energy. By integrating Spotify data, we can create rich user profiles and more accurate music recommendations."
Setup and Authentication:
"To access Spotify data, you'll need to create a Spotify developer account and generate an API key, which will allow us to interact with the Spotify catalog programmatically."
